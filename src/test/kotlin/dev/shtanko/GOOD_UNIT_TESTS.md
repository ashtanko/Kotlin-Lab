# ✅ Characteristics of Good Unit Tests  

- **📝 Readable**  
  A test should clearly communicate what the unit does. A well-chosen test name should make its purpose obvious, eliminating the need to inspect the implementation.  

- **⚡ Fast**  
  Tests should execute within seconds to provide rapid feedback. Slow tests discourage frequent execution. Use mocks to simulate dependencies and keep tests efficient.  

- **🔗 Independent & Isolated**  
  Each test should run independently, without relying on other tests or a specific execution order. A failure in one test should not impact others.  

- **✔️ Correct**  
  A test should do exactly what its name implies. Misleading test names create confusion and reduce trust in test results. Keep test logic aligned with its stated purpose.  

- **🌍 Environment-Agnostic**  
  Tests should run seamlessly on any developer's machine without requiring complex setup. Avoid dependencies on external files, environment variables, or system configurations.  

- **🔁 Repeatable**  
  Running the same test multiple times should always produce the same result. Automate test execution in the build process and fix failing tests promptly to maintain reliability.

By following these principles, you ensure that your unit tests remain clear, efficient, and dependable throughout development. 🚀
