# F.I.R.S.T. Principles of Testing

## 🏎️ Fast

Tests should execute quickly. Slow tests discourage frequent execution, leading to delayed problem detection. If tests
aren’t run regularly, refactoring becomes riskier, and the codebase may degrade over time.

## 🔗 Independent

Tests must not rely on each other. Each test should be self-contained and executable in any order. Dependencies between
tests can create a chain reaction of failures, making debugging harder and obscuring real issues.

## 🔁 Repeatable

Tests should produce consistent results across different environments. Whether running on a production server, a QA
environment, or a local laptop without network access, they should always behave the same. If they aren’t reliably
repeatable, debugging becomes challenging.

## ✅ Self-Validating

A test should yield a clear pass or fail outcome. There should be no need to manually inspect logs or compare files.
Ambiguous test results introduce subjectivity, making failures harder to interpret and increasing the effort required to
validate correctness.

## ⏳ Timely

Tests should be written just before the corresponding production code. Writing tests after implementation can lead to
untestable code, making it harder to ensure correctness. Proactive test writing fosters better design and
maintainability.

By following these principles, you ensure that your tests remain effective, maintainable, and valuable throughout the
software development lifecycle.
