# ❌ Software Testing Anti-Patterns

- **🚫 Unit Tests Without Integration Tests**  
  Relying solely on unit tests can create a false sense of confidence. Integration tests ensure that components work
  together as expected.

- **🔗 Integration Tests Without Unit Tests**  
  Skipping unit tests forces integration tests to catch low-level issues, making debugging harder and slowing down
  development.

- **⚠️ Using the Wrong Types of Tests**  
  Choosing inappropriate test types (e.g., UI tests for business logic) leads to inefficiencies and poor test coverage.

- **🎯 Testing the Wrong Functionality**  
  Focusing on trivial aspects while ignoring critical business logic results in ineffective tests. Prioritize what truly
  matters.

- **🔍 Testing Internal Implementation**  
  Tests should validate behavior, not internal details. Tightly coupling tests to implementation makes refactoring
  difficult.

- **📊 Overemphasizing Test Coverage**  
  High test coverage doesn’t guarantee quality. Prioritize meaningful tests over blindly increasing coverage
  percentages.

- **🐞 Flaky or Slow Tests**  
  Tests that intermittently fail or take too long to run discourage developers from using them. Keep tests stable and
  efficient.

- **🖐️ Running Tests Manually**  
  Automated test execution ensures consistency, saves time, and reduces human errors. Manual test execution is
  inefficient.

- **🏗️ Treating Test Code as Secondary**  
  Well-structured, maintainable test code is just as important as production code. Poor test quality leads to unreliable
  results.

- **🔄 Not Converting Bugs Into Tests**  
  A bug in production should result in a new test to prevent regressions. Ignoring this leads to recurring issues.

- **📜 Treating TDD as Dogma**  
  Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a useful technique, but it’s not always the best approach. Use it when appropriate.

- **📖 Writing Tests Without Reading Documentation**  
  Testing without understanding the system’s requirements or behavior can lead to irrelevant or incorrect tests.

- **🙅‍♂️ Dismissing Testing Due to Misconceptions**  
  A lack of understanding about testing practices can lead to skepticism and resistance. Learn and apply best practices.

- **🏛️ Ignoring the Testing Pyramid**  
  The testing pyramid emphasizes having more unit tests than integration and UI tests. Not following this leads to
  inefficient testing strategies.

- **📊 Misunderstanding the Testing Quadrants**  
  The testing quadrants help balance different types of tests. Ignoring them can leave gaps in test coverage and quality
  assurance.
