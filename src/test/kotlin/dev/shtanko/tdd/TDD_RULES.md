# The TDD Rules

---

## Rule 1

You must write a failing unit test before writing any production code.

## Rule 2

You may only write enough of a unit test to cause it to fail. If the test does not compile, it is considered failing.

## Rule 3

You should only write the minimum amount of production code necessary to make the failing test pass.
