# Composite Pattern in Kotlin

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Example: File System Directory Structure

Consider a scenario where you want to model a directory structure, where both files and directories can contain files or
subdirectories. The Composite pattern can be used to represent this structure.

In this example, we have:

- **`FileSystemComponent`**: An abstract base class that serves as the component in the Composite pattern.
- **`File`**: A class representing a leaf node (a file).
- **`Directory`**: A class representing a composite node (a directory) that can contain files or subdirectories.

The Composite pattern allows us to build hierarchical structures of files and directories, treating them uniformly.

## Use Cases

The Composite pattern is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Hierarchical Structures**: When you need to represent hierarchical structures of objects, such as directories and
   files in a file system, organization departments and employees, or nested graphical elements.

2. **Component-Container Relationships**: When you want to represent a "whole-part" relationship between objects, where
   a single object (composite) contains one or more objects (leaf nodes or other composites).

3. **Uniform Handling**: When you want to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, simplifying
   the client code by using a common interface.

4. **Complexity Management**: When you want to manage complex object structures while maintaining a consistent
   interface, promoting code re-usability and maintainability.

5. **User Interface Components**: When building user interfaces for mobile apps, you often have complex hierarchies of
   UI components. The Composite pattern can be used to represent these hierarchies, treating both individual UI elements
   and composite UI layouts uniformly.

6. **View Controllers or Fragments**: In mobile app development, view controllers (iOS) or fragments (Android) may
   represent different screens or sections of an app. The Composite pattern can be applied to manage the lifecycle and
   interactions of these components.

7. **Nested Data Structures**: Mobile apps often deal with hierarchical data, such as categories and subcategories,
   comments and replies, or multi-level navigation. The Composite pattern can help represent and manage such data
   structures.

8. **Rendering and Layouts**: Rendering complex graphics or layouts on mobile devices can involve compositions of
   elements. The Composite pattern can simplify rendering tasks and provide a consistent approach for handling various
   visual elements.

## Conclusion

The Composite pattern is a powerful tool for building complex tree structures of objects while maintaining a consistent
interface. It simplifies the client code by treating leaf nodes and composite nodes uniformly, promoting code
re-usability and maintainability.
