# Bridge Pattern in Kotlin

The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that separates the abstraction and implementation of a class, allowing
them to vary independently. It promotes flexibility and decouples the higher-level components from their
implementations.

## Use Cases

The Bridge pattern is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

1. When you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, allowing them to be
   extended or modified independently.
2. When you have multiple orthogonal hierarchies that you want to combine, such as different types of UI controls and
   their various styles.
3. When you want to share an implementation among multiple objects, and changes to the implementation should not affect
   the clients.

## Example: Remote Control and Devices

Consider a scenario where you have different types of remote controls and various devices that can be controlled. The
Bridge pattern can be used to separate the remote control logic from the device implementation, allowing them to evolve
independently.

In this example, we have:

- **Devices**: `TV` and `Radio` classes that represent different types of devices.
- **Remote Controls**: `BasicRemote` and `AdvancedRemote` classes that represent different types of remote controls.

The Bridge pattern allows us to control devices using different remote controls without the need to modify the device or
remote control classes when adding new types.

## Conclusion

The Bridge pattern is a powerful tool for separating abstraction and implementation, providing flexibility and allowing
components to evolve independently. It promotes clean, maintainable code by reducing tight coupling between different
hierarchies.

the [Gang of Four book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) or various design pattern tutorials.
