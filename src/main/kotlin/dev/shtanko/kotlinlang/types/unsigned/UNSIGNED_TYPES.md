âœ… 1. Binary & Bitwise Operations
Unsigned types are helpful when doing bit manipulation, as they prevent issues with sign extension and simplify logic.

```kotlin
val mask: UByte = 0b11110000u
val value: UByte = 0b10101010u
val result = value and mask // no unexpected sign problems
```

âœ… 2. Working with Raw Data / Buffers
When you're processing binary files, network packets, or image data, values are often naturally unsigned.

```kotlin
val bytes: UByteArray = ubyteArrayOf(0xFFu, 0x01u, 0x7Fu)
```

âœ… 3. Interfacing with C / Native Code (JNI / NDK / WASM)
If you're using Kotlin/Native or Kotlin/Multiplatform and talking to native libraries, they often expect unsigned types.

```kotlin
external fun nativeRead(buffer: UByteArray): UInt
```

âœ… 4. Avoiding Negative Values by Design
If a value should never be negative (like an ID, count, size, etc.), unsigned types make your intention clearer and catch errors earlier.

```kotlin
fun createUser(id: UInt) { /* ... */ }
```

âœ… 5. Cryptography / Checksums / Hashes
Crypto algorithms and checksums often rely on unsigned integer arithmetic.

```kotlin
val temperatureRaw: UShort = readSensor()
```

âœ… 6. Embedded / IoT / Microcontroller Code
For constrained environments or devices (like Arduino, STM32, etc.), values are usually unsigned and memory-efficient.

```kotlin
val temperatureRaw: UShort = readSensor()
```

âœ… 7. Performance & Precision with Large Positive Numbers
Sometimes you need the extra upper range â€” e.g. ULong gives you up to 2^64 - 1, while Long is capped at 2^63 - 1.

```kotlin
val bigCounter: ULong = 18_446_744_073_709_551_615u
```

A note of caution ðŸš§
Kotlinâ€™s unsigned types are not Java-compatible, meaning:

You can't pass UInt directly to Java code (youâ€™ll need to convert it to Int)

Some standard library functions may not work the same way
