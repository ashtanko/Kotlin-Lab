## 🧠 Software Design Best Practices

This project follows industry-standard best practices to ensure the codebase is **clean**, **scalable**, and **maintainable**.

### ✨ Design Principles

- **SOLID** Principles:
  - **S**ingle Responsibility — each class does one thing well.
  - **O**pen/Closed — code is extendable without modifying existing logic.
  - **L**iskov Substitution — subclasses behave like their parent class.
  - **I**nterface Segregation — prefer small, focused interfaces.
  - **D**ependency Inversion — rely on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

- **DRY**: Don’t Repeat Yourself — shared logic is extracted and reused.
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple — avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **YAGNI**: You Aren’t Gonna Need It — don’t add code for unconfirmed needs.
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data access are clearly separated.

### 🏗 Architecture

- **Layered architecture**:
  - `Presentation`: Handles UI and user interaction.
  - `Domain`: Core business logic and rules.
  - `Data`: API, database, and persistence logic.

- **Modular structure** by feature/domain for better scalability and code ownership.

---

### 🧪 Testing

- Unit-tested core logic using a test-driven mindset.
- Components are loosely coupled and easy to mock.
- CI pipelines automatically run tests on every commit.

---

### 📐 Patterns & Practices

- **Composition over inheritance** — promotes flexibility.
- **Factory**, **Strategy**, and **Repository** patterns used when appropriate.
- Followed **Domain-Driven Design** principles in complex areas.

---

### 🔧 Code Quality

- Small, focused functions and classes.
- Clear and descriptive naming.
- Code is self-documenting; minimal and meaningful comments.
- Regular refactoring to improve structure without changing behavior.

---

### 🤝 Team Conventions

- Code reviews for all pull requests.
- Consistent formatting and linting enforced.
- All business logic documented in high-level overviews.
