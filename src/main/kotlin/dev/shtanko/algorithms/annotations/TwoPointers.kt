/**
 * # How Two Pointers Work
 * * Initialization: Typically, you initialize two pointers at different positions.
 * For example, one pointer might start at the beginning of an array, and the other might start at the end.
 * * Movement: The pointers are then moved towards each other or in a way that helps in achieving the desired condition.
 * This movement is usually based on some condition or criteria defined by the problem.
 * * Comparison or Calculation: At each step, you perform some comparison or calculation involving the elements at the
 * pointersâ€™ positions.
 * * Termination: The process continues until the pointers meet or cross each other, or until a certain condition is met
