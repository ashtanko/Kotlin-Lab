/**
 * Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected
 * graph.
 * The algorithm works by selecting the edges with the smallest weight and adding them to the MST, provided they do not
 * form a cycle.
 * This process continues until the MST contains exactly (V-1) edges, where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
 *
 * # How It Works
 *
 * 1: Sort All Edges:
 * The first step is to sort all the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.
 *
 * 2: Select the Smallest Edge:
 * Start by selecting the smallest edge and add it to the MST if it does not form a cycle with the already chosen edges.
 * This check is typically done using a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure.
 *
 * 3: Repeat:
 * Continue selecting the smallest edges and adding them to the MST, until the MST contains (V - 1) edges.
 *
 * # Example:
 * In a graph with vertices A, B, C, and D, and edges with weights:
 * - (A, B) = 1, (A, C) = 3, (B, C) = 2, (C, D) = 4
 * The algorithm will first select (A, B), then (B, C), and finally (C, D), resulting in the MST with
 * edges (A, B), (B, C), and (C, D).
 *
 * # Advantages:
 * * Greedy Approach: Kruskalâ€™s algorithm is a greedy algorithm that ensures the MST is constructed in a way that
 * guarantees optimality.
 * * Efficient: Sorting the edges takes O(E log E) time, and the union-find operations take nearly constant time,
 * resulting in an overall time complexity of O(E log E).
 *
 * # Common Applications:
 * - Network design (e.g., designing a minimal-cost network)
 * - Cluster analysis (e.g., connecting data points with minimum cost)
 *
