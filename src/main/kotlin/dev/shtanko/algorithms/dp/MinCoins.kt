 * Coin Change Problem
 * Given a set of coins and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.

 * Find the minimum number of coins needed to make up a given amount using dynamic programming.
 *
 * @param coins An array of coin denominations.
 * @param amount The target amount to make up.
 * @return The minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount. Returns -1 if it's not possible.
