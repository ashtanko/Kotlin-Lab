/**
 * Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm dividing the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already
 * sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items remaining
 * to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist
 * is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order)
 * element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element
 * (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
 *
 * Worst-case performance       O(n^2)
 * Best-case performance        O(n^2)
 * Average performance          O(n^2)
 * Worst-case space complexity  O(1)
