/**
 * Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959, with his work published in 1961, Quicksort is an efficient sort algorithm using
 * divide and conquer approach. Quicksort first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements
 * and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays. The steps are:
 * 1) Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array.
 * 2) Partitioning: reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot,
 * while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way).
 * After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation.
 * 3) Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to
 * the sub-array of elements with greater values.
 *
 * Worst-case performance       O(n^2)
 * Best-case performance        O(nLogn)
 * Average performance          O(nLogn)
 * Worst-case space complexity  O(1)
