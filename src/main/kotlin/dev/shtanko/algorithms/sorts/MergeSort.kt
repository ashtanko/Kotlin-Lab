/**
 * Invented in 1945 by John von Neumann, merge sort is an efficient algorithm using the divide and conquer approach
 * which is to divide a big problem into smaller problems and solve them. Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
 * 1) Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
 * 2) Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.
 *
 * Worst-case performance       O(n log n)
 * Best-case performance        O(n log n)
 * Average performance          O(n log n)
 * Worst-case space complexity  O(n)
