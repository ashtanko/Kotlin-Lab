/**
 * Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection
 * sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process
 * for remaining element.
 *
 * Worst-case performance       O(n*log(n))
 * Best-case performance        O(n*log(n))
 * Average-case performance     O(n*log(n))
 * Worst-case space complexity  O(1) (auxiliary)
