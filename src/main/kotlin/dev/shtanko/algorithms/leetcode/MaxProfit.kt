 * Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock 2
 *
 * This function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling stocks.
 * The input is an array where the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
 * You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *
 * @receiver IntArray the input array of stock prices.
 * @return Int the maximum profit that can be achieved.
