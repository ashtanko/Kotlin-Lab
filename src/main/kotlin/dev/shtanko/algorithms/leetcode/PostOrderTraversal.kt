/**
 * Extension function for TreeNode? to perform a post-order traversal of a binary tree.
 *
 * Post-order traversal is a tree traversal method where each node is processed after its subtrees.
 * In this method, the root is visited last, hence the name. The order of the traversal is left subtree, right subtree,
 * and then the root.
 * This function uses an iterative approach with a stack to keep track of nodes.
 *
 * @return List<Int> A list of node values in the order they were visited during the post-order traversal.
