/**
 * Island Perimeter
 *
 * [Problem]
 * You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents
 * water.
 *
 * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water,
 * and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
 *
 * The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island.
 * One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100.
 * Determine the perimeter of the island.
 *
 * [Example]
 * Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
 * Output: 16
 *
 * [Constraints]
 * - row == grid.length
 * - col == grid[i].length
 * - 1 <= row, col <= 100
 * - grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
