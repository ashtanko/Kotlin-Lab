/**
 * Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock
 *
 * This function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling stocks.
 * The input is an array where the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * You may only complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple
 * times).
 * However, you must sell the stock before you buy again.
 *
 * The function uses a simple algorithm where it iterates over the array and for each pair of elements,
 * it calculates the difference and adds it to the current maximum if it's positive.
 * The maximum of the current maximum and the total maximum so far is then stored as the total maximum.
 *
 * @receiver IntArray the input array of stock prices.
 * @return Int the maximum profit that can be achieved.
