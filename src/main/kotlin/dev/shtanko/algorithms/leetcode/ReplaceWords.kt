/**
 * # Intuition
 * The idea is to replace words in the given sentence with their corresponding roots from the dictionary.
 * This can be efficiently achieved by checking prefixes of each word in the sentence against the roots in the
 * dictionary.
 *
 * # Approach
 * 1. Convert the dictionary of roots into a set for quick look-up.
 * 2. Split the sentence into individual words.
 * 3. For each word, find the shortest prefix that exists in the set of roots.
 * 4. Construct the resulting sentence using these prefixes.
 *
 * # Complexity
 * - Time complexity:
 * The time complexity is $$O(n \cdot m)$$, where \(n\) is the number of words in the sentence and \(m\) is the
 * maximum length of a word.
 * In the worst case, for each word, we might check every prefix (up to the length of the word) against the set
 * of roots.
 *
 * - Space complexity:
 * The space complexity is $$O(k)$$, where \(k\) is the total number of characters in the dictionary.
 * This space is used to store the roots in the set. Additionally, we use $$O(1)$$ extra space for the result
 * construction.

/**
 * # Intuition
 * The goal is to replace words in the given sentence with the shortest root from the dictionary.
 * A Trie (prefix tree) is well-suited for this task as it efficiently stores the roots and allows for quick
 * prefix searches.
 *
 * # Approach
 * 1. Build a Trie from the given dictionary of root words.
 * 2. Split the sentence into individual words.
 * 3. For each word, traverse the Trie to find the shortest root that matches a prefix of the word.
 * 4. Construct the resulting sentence using these roots or the original words if no root is found.
 *
 * # Complexity
 * - Time complexity:
 * The time complexity is $$O(n \cdot m)$$, where \(n\) is the number of words in the sentence and \(m\)
 * is the average length of the words. Building the Trie takes $$O(k)$$ time, where \(k\) is the total number
 * of characters in the dictionary.
 *
 * - Space complexity:
 * The space complexity is $$O(k)$$, where \(k\) is the total number of characters in the dictionary.
 * This space is used to store the Trie. Additionally, we use $$O(1)$$ extra space for the result construction.
