/**
 * This function is an implementation of the Two Sum II problem from LeetCode.
 * It takes an array of integers and a target integer as input.
 * The function returns an array of two integers, which are the 1-indexed positions of the two numbers in the input
 * array that add up to the target.
 * The input array is assumed to be sorted in ascending order, and only one valid answer exists.
 *
 * @param target The target integer.
 * @return An array of two integers, which are the 1-indexed positions of the two numbers in the input array that add
 * up to the target.
