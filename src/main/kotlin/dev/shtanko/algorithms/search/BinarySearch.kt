/**
 * In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a
 * search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
 * Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
 *
 * Worst-case performance       O(log(n))
 * Best-case performance        O(1)
 * Average performance          O(log(n))
 * Worst-case space complexity  O(1)
