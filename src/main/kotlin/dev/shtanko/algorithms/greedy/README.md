Greedy algorithm always selects the best option available to it at the moment,
without considering the impact of that choice on future steps.
The algorithm makes a series of decisions, each one based only on the information available at the time,
without looking ahead to see if the choice made will result in the best overall outcome.

While this approach doesn't always lead to the absolute best possible solution,
it can often be an effective and efficient way to solve certain types of problems where an approximate solution is good
enough.

Some common examples of problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms include the "knapsack problem," scheduling
tasks,
and finding the shortest path in a network.
