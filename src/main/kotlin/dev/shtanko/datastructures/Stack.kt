/**
 * A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought of as a linear structure represented by a real
 * physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of
 * the stack. The basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set as a stack of plates or books where
 * you can only take the top item off the stack in order to remove things from it. This structure is used all
 * throughout programming. The basic implementation of a stack is also called a LIFO (Last In First Out) to demonstrate
 * the way it accesses data, since as we will see there are various variations of stack implementations.
 * There are basically three operations that can be performed on stacks. They are 1) inserting an item into
 * a stack (push). 2) deleting an item from the stack (pop). 3) displaying the contents of the stack (peek or top).
