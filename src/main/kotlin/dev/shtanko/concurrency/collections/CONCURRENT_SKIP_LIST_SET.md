## 🧠 `ConcurrentSkipListSet`

`ConcurrentSkipListSet` is a **thread-safe** **Set** implementation backed by a `ConcurrentSkipListMap`. It is a **non-blocking**, **sorted** collection that allows **efficient** concurrent operations while maintaining elements in a **sorted order**. Like `ConcurrentSkipListMap`, it supports high concurrency for read and write operations.

---

### 🔍 Key Features

- **Thread-safe**: Supports safe concurrent access for multiple threads.
- **Non-blocking**: Operations like `add()`, `remove()`, and `contains()` are **non-blocking**, ensuring high throughput in concurrent environments.
- **Sorted**: Automatically maintains elements in **sorted order** (either by the natural ordering of elements or a provided comparator).
- **Efficient operations**: Provides **O(log n)** time complexity for `add()`, `remove()`, and `contains()` operations.
- **Unbounded**: It grows as needed (limited only by memory).

---

### ✅ When to Use

- ✅ You need a **sorted** and **thread-safe** collection.
- ✅ You require **efficient concurrent** operations (read/write) without blocking threads.
- ✅ You need to maintain unique elements while ensuring the collection remains sorted automatically.
- ✅ A **non-blocking** alternative to `TreeSet` in concurrent environments.

---

### ❌ When Not to Use

- ❌ If you don’t need a sorted collection or if you don’t need thread safety (consider using a simpler `HashSet` or `ConcurrentHashSet`).
- ❌ If you need blocking operations or coordination between threads (consider using other concurrency utilities).

### 📌 Kotlin Example

```kotlin
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet

fun main() {
    // Creating a thread-safe sorted set
    val set = ConcurrentSkipListSet<Int>()

    // Adding elements (automatically sorted)
    set.add(5)
    set.add(3)
    set.add(8)
    set.add(1)

    // Iterating over the set (automatically sorted)
    println("Iterating through the sorted set:")
    for (item in set) {
        println(item)
    }

    // Checking if a value exists
    println("Does the set contain 3? ${set.contains(3)}")  // Output: true
    println("Does the set contain 7? ${set.contains(7)}")  // Output: false

    // Removing an element
    set.remove(5)
    println("After removing 5:")
    for (item in set) {
        println(item)
    }

    // Demonstrating thread-safe concurrent modification
    val threads = List(5) { i ->
        Thread {
            set.add(i * 10)
        }
    }

    threads.forEach { it.start() }
    threads.forEach { it.join() }

    println("Set after concurrent modifications:")
    for (item in set) {
        println(item)
    }
}
```
