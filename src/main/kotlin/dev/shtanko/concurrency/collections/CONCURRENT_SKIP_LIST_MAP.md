## 🧠 `ConcurrentSkipListMap`

`ConcurrentSkipListMap` is a **thread-safe** and **non-blocking** **SortedMap** implementation based on a skip list. It maintains elements in a **sorted order** and allows **high concurrency** for reading and writing operations. The skip list allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, similar to balanced trees but with simpler implementation.

### 🔍 Key Features

- **Thread-safe**: Supports safe concurrent access for multiple threads.
- **Non-blocking**: Operations such as `get()`, `put()`, and `remove()` are **non-blocking**, making it suitable for high-concurrency environments.
- **Sorted**: Automatically maintains elements in **sorted order** based on the **natural ordering** of keys or a provided comparator.
- **Efficient operations**: Provides **O(log n)** time complexity for `get()`, `put()`, and `remove()` operations.
- **Unbounded**: It can grow indefinitely as long as memory allows.

---

### ✅ When to Use

- ✅ You need a **thread-safe** map that maintains **sorted order**.
- ✅ You want efficient **concurrent** access to elements, with operations that do not block.
- ✅ You require high-performance operations on large datasets, especially where key order matters.
- ✅ A **non-blocking** alternative to `TreeMap` in concurrent environments.

---

### ❌ When Not to Use

- ❌ If you need to support blocking operations or thread coordination (e.g., consider using `ConcurrentHashMap` with external synchronization).
- ❌ If you don’t require a **sorted map**, other simpler structures like `HashMap` or `ConcurrentHashMap` might suffice.

### 📌 Kotlin Example

```kotlin
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap

fun main() {
    // Creating a thread-safe sorted map with String keys and Integer values
    val map = ConcurrentSkipListMap<String, Int>()

    // Adding elements to the map
    map["apple"] = 5
    map["banana"] = 3
    map["cherry"] = 8
    map["date"] = 6

    // Iterating over the map (automatically sorted by keys)
    println("Iterating through the sorted map:")
    for ((key, value) in map) {
        println("$key => $value")
    }

    // Checking if a key exists and accessing values
    println("Does the map contain 'banana'? ${map.containsKey("banana")}")  // Output: true
    println("Value associated with 'cherry': ${map["cherry"]}")               // Output: 8

    // Removing an element
    map.remove("apple")

    // Final state of the map
    println("After removal of 'apple':")
    for ((key, value) in map) {
        println("$key => $value")
    }

    // Demonstrating thread-safe concurrent modification
    val threads = List(5) { i ->
        Thread {
            map["key-$i"] = i * 10
        }
    }

    threads.forEach { it.start() }
    threads.forEach { it.join() }

    println("Map after concurrent modifications:")
    for ((key, value) in map) {
        println("$key => $value")
    }
}
```
