# üöÄ Starvation in Java: Understanding the Problem and Solutions  

## üîπ What is Starvation?  
**Starvation** occurs when a thread is **perpetually denied access** to necessary resources, preventing it from making progress. This typically happens when **higher-priority threads or resource-hogging threads** continuously consume the available CPU or synchronization locks, leaving lower-priority threads **waiting indefinitely**.  

---

## üî• Problem: Why Does Starvation Occur?  
Starvation happens when:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Thread Priority Imbalance**  
   - Threads with **higher priority** keep executing, while lower-priority threads get **little to no CPU time**.  
   - Example: A **high-priority** thread is always scheduled before a **low-priority** thread.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Unfair Locking (Biased Locking)**  
   - A thread might **never acquire a lock** if other threads keep **acquiring and releasing** it quickly.  
   - Example: A thread waiting for a **synchronized** block but never gets a turn because other threads **continuously hold the lock**.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Unfair Resource Allocation**  
   - Shared resources are **continuously consumed** by a few threads, **preventing** other threads from using them.  
   - Example: A **thread pool** where some worker threads **always get tasks**, while others remain idle.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Frequent Lock Contention**  
   - If a lock is frequently **acquired and released** by the same few threads, **other threads may never get access**.  
   - Example: A **database connection pool** where a few connections are always occupied by the same threads.
