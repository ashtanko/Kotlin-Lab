import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock

/**
 * `ReadWriteLock` is a synchronization aid in Java that allows multiple threads to read shared data concurrently while
 * ensuring that writes to the data are exclusive. It provides a way to improve performance in scenarios where reads are
 * more frequent than writes, as it allows multiple readers to access the data simultaneously but only one writer can
 * modify the data at a time.
 *
 * Key Concepts
 * 1. Read and Write Locks
 * Read Lock: Multiple threads can acquire the read lock simultaneously as long as no thread holds the write lock.
 * This is suitable for scenarios where reading is more frequent than writing.
 * Write Lock: Only one thread can acquire the write lock at a time, and it has exclusive access to the data.
 * During this period, no other thread can acquire either the read or write lock.
 * 2. Locking Behavior
 * Shared Access: Multiple threads can hold the read lock concurrently.
 * Exclusive Access: Only one thread can hold the write lock, and it must be the only thread holding the lock when
 * modifying the shared data.
 * Usage
 * In Kotlin, you use ReadWriteLock from the java.util.concurrent.locks package. Hereâ€™s an example of how to
 * use ReadWriteLock:
