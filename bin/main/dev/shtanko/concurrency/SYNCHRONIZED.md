Synchronized in JVM

Synchronized is a keyword in Java that is used to mark a method or a block of code as synchronized. When a method is marked as synchronized, the thread that is executing it is granted a lock on the object the method belongs to. This means that no other thread can execute any synchronized method on the same object until the current thread releases the lock. This is a simple and effective way to ensure that only one thread can access a resource at a time.  
How Synchronization Works
Method-Level Synchronization: When a method is declared as synchronized, the thread holds the lock for the object on which the method is called. Other threads cannot call any synchronized method on the same object until the lock is released.  
Block-Level Synchronization: A block of code can be synchronized using the synchronized keyword. The thread holds the lock for the specified object within the block. This allows more fine-grained control over synchronization.  
Intrinsic Locks: Every object in Java has an intrinsic lock (or monitor lock). When a thread enters a synchronized method or block, it acquires the intrinsic lock for that object. When it exits the method or block, it releases the lock.  
Reentrant Locks: Java's intrinsic locks are reentrant. This means that if a thread already holds the lock for an object, it can re-enter any synchronized method or block on that object without deadlocking.  
Thread Safety: Synchronized methods and blocks ensure that only one thread can execute them at a time on a given object, preventing concurrent access issues and ensuring thread safety.
Benefits of Synchronized
Thread Safety: Synchronized methods ensure that only one thread can execute them at a time on a given object, preventing data corruption and ensuring consistency.
Atomicity: Synchronized blocks provide atomicity, ensuring that a series of operations are executed as a single, indivisible step.
Visibility: Changes made by one thread to a synchronized block are visible to other threads, ensuring that they see the most up-to-date state of shared variables.
