/**
 * In Kotlin, the concept of `ThreadLocal` is similar to Java. You use the ThreadLocal class from Java to provide
 * thread-local variables. Hereâ€™s how you can use ThreadLocal in Kotlin:
 *
 * Key Concepts
 * 1. Isolation of Data
 * ThreadLocal provides each thread with its own instance of a variable, ensuring that the variable is not shared
 * between threads.
 *
 * 2. How It Works
 * Each thread that accesses the ThreadLocal variable gets its own copy, and changes made by one thread are not visible
 * to others.
