# Inorder Traversal

Inorder traversal is a type of depth-first traversal used primarily for binary trees.
In this method, nodes are visited in a specific order: left subtree, root, and right subtree. 
This order ensures that the nodes are processed in ascending order for binary search trees.

## Inorder Traversal Steps

1. **Visit the left subtree**
2. **Visit the root node**
3. **Visit the right subtree**

This process is recursively applied to each node, ensuring that each node is visited in the correct order.
