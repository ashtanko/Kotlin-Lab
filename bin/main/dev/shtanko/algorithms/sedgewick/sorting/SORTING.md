Sorting algorithms (Chapter 2) for rearranging arrays in order are of fundamental
importance. We consider a variety of algorithms in considerable depth, including insertion sort, selection sort,
shellsort, quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort. We also encounter algorithms for several related problems, including
priority queues, selection,
and merging. Many of these algorithms will find application as the basis for other algorithms later in the book.
