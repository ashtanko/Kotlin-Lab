Fundamentals (Chapter 1) in the context of this book are the basic principles and
methodology that we use to implement, analyze, and compare algorithms. We consider
our Java programming model, data abstraction, basic data structures, abstract data
types for collections, methods of analyzing algorithm performance, and a case study.
