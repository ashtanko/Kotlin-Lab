# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique used in computer science and mathematics to solve problems by breaking them
down into smaller, overlapping subproblems. It's particularly useful for optimization problems where you need to find
the best solution among many possible solutions. Dynamic programming can significantly improve the efficiency of your
algorithms by avoiding redundant calculations.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Overlapping Subproblems

Dynamic programming involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. Importantly, these
subproblems often overlap, meaning that the same subproblem is solved multiple times. Dynamic programming stores the
results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### 2. Memoization

Memoization is a common technique in dynamic programming where you store the results of expensive function calls and
return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This technique is often used in top-down approaches.

### 3. Bottom-Up Approach

In the bottom-up approach, you start by solving the smallest subproblems first and then use their solutions to build up
to the main problem. It often involves creating a table or array to store intermediate results.

### 4. Examples

Here are some classic problems that can be solved using dynamic programming:

- **Fibonacci Sequence:** Finding the nth Fibonacci number efficiently.
- **Coin Change Problem:** Determining the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.
- **Longest Common Subsequence:** Finding the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
- **Knapsack Problem:** Selecting items with maximum value within a weight constraint.

## When to Use Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is suitable for problems with the following characteristics:

- **Optimization:** The problem involves finding the best solution among many possible solutions.
- **Overlapping Subproblems:** The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that overlap.
- **Memoization or Recomputation:** It's more efficient to store and reuse subproblem solutions than to recompute them.
