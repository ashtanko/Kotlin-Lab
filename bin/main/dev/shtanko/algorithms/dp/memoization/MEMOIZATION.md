# Memoization in Dynamic Programming

Memoization is a technique used in dynamic programming to optimize algorithms by storing and reusing the results of
expensive function calls. It is particularly useful when solving problems with overlapping subproblems, as it avoids
redundant calculations. This README provides an overview of memoization and how to use it effectively.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Caching Results

Memoization involves caching or storing the results of expensive function calls so that they can be quickly retrieved
when the same inputs occur again. This eliminates the need to recompute the same results multiple times.

### 2. Recursive Approach

Memoization is often used in combination with a recursive approach. When solving a problem recursively, you check
whether the solution for a particular set of inputs has already been computed and cached. If it has, you retrieve the
cached result; otherwise, you calculate and store the result.

### 3. Data Structure for Caching

The choice of data structure for caching results depends on the problem. Common choices include arrays, dictionaries, or
other data structures that allow for efficient lookups based on the input parameters.

## How to Use Memoization

To use memoization effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Define a Recursive Function:** Start by defining a recursive function that can solve the problem. Ensure that the
   function takes the necessary input parameters.

2. **Create a Cache:** Create a data structure (e.g., an array or a dictionary) to serve as a cache for storing results.
   The cache should allow you to associate input parameters with computed results.

3. **Check the Cache:** In the recursive function, check if the result for the given input parameters already exists in
   the cache. If it does, return the cached result.

4. **Calculate and Store:** If the result is not found in the cache, calculate it as usual and store it in the cache
   with the input parameters as the key.

5. **Recursive Calls:** Continue making recursive calls to the function as needed, always checking the cache before
   performing calculations.

6. **Base Cases:** Make sure to define base cases in the recursive function to handle the simplest, non-divisible
   subproblems.
