# Top-Down Dynamic Programming (Memoization)

The top-down dynamic programming approach, also known as memoization, is a technique used to solve problems by breaking
them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems and solving them recursively. It optimizes algorithms by storing and
reusing the results of expensive function calls. This README provides an overview of the top-down approach and how to
use it effectively.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Recursion with Memoization

In the top-down approach, you solve problems recursively by dividing them into smaller subproblems. However, you also
store the results of these subproblems in a data structure (often an array or dictionary) called a memoization table.
This allows you to avoid redundant calculations.

### 2. Cache Results

Memoization involves caching or storing the results of function calls based on their input parameters. When a function
is called with the same parameters again, the cached result is retrieved instead of recalculating it.

### 3. Recursive Approach

The top-down approach usually involves a recursive function that checks the memoization table for previously computed
results. If the result is found, it is returned; otherwise, the function calculates and stores the result.

## How to Use Top-Down Dynamic Programming

To use the top-down approach effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Define a Recursive Function:** Start by defining a recursive function that can solve the problem. Ensure that the
   function takes the necessary input parameters.

2. **Create a Memoization Table:** Create a memoization table (data structure) to store results. Initialize it with
   default values to indicate that results have not been computed yet.

3. **Check the Memoization Table:** In the recursive function, check if the result for the given input parameters
   already exists in the memoization table. If it does, return the cached result.

4. **Calculate and Store:** If the result is not found in the table, calculate it as usual and store it in the table
   with the input parameters as the key.

5. **Recursive Calls:** Continue making recursive calls to the function as needed, always checking the memoization table
   before performing calculations.

6. **Base Cases:** Define base cases in the recursive function to handle the simplest, non-divisible subproblems.
